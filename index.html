				<h3>About The Dudes: two unlikely individuals come together to make music, video and other forms of art. The results are getting better all the time. But they really should: they've been at it for the better part of the decade and fruits are starting to emerge. The dudes are far from normal but they clearly try to use what they have. And it is good to see, hear and experience. One more time into the domain of the artist - maybe. </h3>

					<h2> <b> â˜œ </b> See this video here - maybe. With a very limited budget and only five actors and extras to play the roles a documentary of lives wasted was created. With a bit of rock, a measure of  drugs and quite a lot of sex this auteur production has critics divided. Filmed in B&W with a self-made soundtrack. See it and be shocked - maybe.   <h2/>
